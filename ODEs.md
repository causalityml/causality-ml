# Numerical Analysis for Ordinary Differential Equations

This page serves as a permanent landing page for publications and code on
probabilistic methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations. This
particular html page is used by Philipp Hennig's research group, but it is part
of a wider research effort to study the possibility of assigning uncertainty to
the result of deterministic
computations. [The corresponding community page can be found here]({{site.baseurl}}/index.html).
